To add a widget - simply click the *plus* icon and the widget will appear in the "Widgets currently used" column.

After you've finished adding widgets, publish your blog, and your freshly minted widgets will appear in your blog's sidebar.

### Archive

The archive widget helps you keep historical content relevant, by generating a list of posts, ordered by month or year.
